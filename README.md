### Network Security Project For Phising Data

Here's a sample `README.md` file for your GitHub repository [`NetworkSecurity`](https://github.com/HimanshuB0810/NetworkSecurity.git). This version assumes your project follows a typical machine learning pipeline related to network security:

---

```
# Network Security using Machine Learning

This project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to improve network security. It includes a complete ML pipeline—from data ingestion to model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## 🔐 Overview

With increasing cyber threats, predictive models can help detect and mitigate attacks before they occur. This repository implements a classification pipeline that identifies suspicious patterns in network data.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HimanshuB0810/NetworkSecurity.git
cd NetworkSecurity
````

### Create a virtual environment

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🧪 Run the Training Pipeline

```
python main.py
```

---

## 📊 MLflow Tracking

Make sure MLflow is installed and run:

```
mlflow ui
```

Then open your browser at: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

---

## 📡 API Usage (FastAPI)

Start the FastAPI server:

```
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Open in browser: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
